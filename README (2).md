## ✨ Features

*   ➕ **Account Management:** Easily add and remove user accounts from a central system.
*   🔍 **Membership Checking:** Quickly verify if a user account exists within the active set.
*   🤝 **Set Operations:** Perform advanced operations like finding common accounts (intersection) or combining multiple account lists (union).
*   🚀 **Lightweight & Efficient:** Built with Python's native set data structure for optimal performance.
*   📚 **Clear & Simple API:** Straightforward functions for intuitive interaction with account sets.


## 🚀 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get `account-set-operations` up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhammhaske-6610/account-set-operations.git
cd account-set-operations
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

This project is currently self-contained and has no external Python dependencies. If any were added in the future, you would install them like this:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is not currently present as the project is simple, but this is the standard command.)*


## 💡 Usage Examples

This project utilizes Python's built-in set operations to manage user accounts. Below are some common usage patterns.

### Basic Account Management

```python
# user_account_sets.py
class AccountManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.active_accounts = set()

    def add_account(self, username):
        self.active_accounts.add(username)
        print(f"Added: {username}")

    def remove_account(self, username):
        if username in self.active_accounts:
            self.active_accounts.remove(username)
            print(f"Removed: {username}")
        else:
            print(f"{username} not found.")

    def is_account_active(self, username):
        return username in self.active_accounts

    def get_all_active_accounts(self):
        return sorted(list(self.active_accounts))

    def union_accounts(self, other_accounts_set):
        return self.active_accounts.union(other_accounts_set)

    def intersect_accounts(self, other_accounts_set):
        return self.active_accounts.intersection(other_accounts_set)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    manager = AccountManager()

    print("--- Initializing Accounts ---")
    manager.add_account("alice")
    manager.add_account("bob")
    manager.add_account("charlie")
    manager.add_account("david")
    print(f"Current active accounts: {manager.get_all_active_accounts()}")

    print("\n--- Checking Account Status ---")
    print(f"Is 'alice' active? {manager.is_account_active('alice')}")
    print(f"Is 'eve' active? {manager.is_account_active('eve')}")

    print("\n--- Removing an Account ---")
    manager.remove_account("bob")
    manager.remove_account("frank") # Try removing a non-existent account
    print(f"Current active accounts: {manager.get_all_active_accounts()}")

    print("\n--- Performing Set Operations ---")
    new_signups = {"eve", "frank", "alice"}
    print(f"New sign-ups: {new_signups}")

    all_potential_accounts = manager.union_accounts(new_signups)
    print(f"All potential accounts (union): {sorted(list(all_potential_accounts))}")

    common_accounts = manager.intersect_accounts(new_signups)
    print(f"Accounts common to active and new sign-ups (intersection): {sorted(list(common_accounts))}")
```

### Running the Example

To run the example, execute the `user_account_sets.py` file:

```bash
python user_account_sets.py
```


## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

Our journey with `account-set-operations` is just beginning. Here's a glimpse of what's planned:

*   **Version 1.1.0:**
    *   🌐 Implement persistent storage for accounts (e.g., JSON file, SQLite).
    *   📊 Add functionality to track account metadata (e.g., creation date, last login).
    *   🧪 Expand unit test coverage for all core functionalities.
*   **Future Enhancements:**
    *   CLI interface for easier interaction.
    *   Support for multiple account groups/roles.
    *   Integration with external authentication systems (e.g., OAuth).
