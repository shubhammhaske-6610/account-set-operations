# 🗂️ User Account Sets

A **simple Python project** for managing user accounts using **set operations**.  
This project demonstrates how Python sets can be used to manage unique user data and perform operations like union, intersection, and difference.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add user details (Name, Contact, City, Account Number) to **two separate sets**.  
- ✅ View both sets of users.  
- ✅ Perform **union** of sets (all unique values).  
- ✅ Perform **intersection** of sets (common values between sets).  
- ✅ Perform **difference** of sets (values only in `set_a`).  
- ✅ Easy-to-use **menu-driven interface**.
